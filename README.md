**This is still a work in progress. Not ready for production use**
# Getting Started

 - Initialize new database export and configure
 ``` $ mosql export init <namespace> ```
above command will prompt you for more details about the export
	 `$ Source database name: `
   	 `$ Source database connection string: `
         `$ Destination database name: `
	 `$ Destination database connection string: `
   	 `$ Collections to exclude (comma separated): `
	 `$ Collections to include (comma separated, no value means include all collections): `
	 `$ User name (optional): `
	 `$ Email (optional): `
	 `$ Save (Y/N - Press Y to save and N to change the export details): `
	If you press N and hit enter, you can change the details of the export. Press up or down arrow to skip through the details to update.

	If you press Y and if everything goes well, new export is created and you will see a success message with options for next actions you can take
    ```
    âœ… Export created with namespace <namespace>
    Now you can either generate a default schema mapping or run export with default mapping with following commands
	    1) $ mosql export generate_mapping <namespace>
	    2) $ mosql export run <namespace>
   ```
	Directly running an export also generates a default schema mapping behind the scenes. But, it's recommended to generate a mapping and verify before running an export

 - Generate default schema mappings - this command helps generate the default mappings between the mongo collections to postgres tables which you can modify it. By default, collection keys are mapped to postgres table column name one-to-one. Some default convention followed for this default mapping
			 - collection name is converted to snake case for SQL table name. e.g. collection `emailLogs` become `email_logs`
			 - collection key also gets converted to snake case if they are camel case. e.g. `userId` becomes `user_id`
			 - Data type conversion

| Mongo Type | Postgres Type |
|--|--|
| string | text |
| object id | text |
| double, decimal | numeric |
| int32 | integer |
| int64 | bigint |
| bool | boolean |
| Timestamp, DateTime | timestamp with time zone |
| default or unknown type | text |
