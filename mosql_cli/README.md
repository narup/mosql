## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `mosql_cli` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mosql_cli, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/mosql_cli](https://hexdocs.pm/mosql_cli).
